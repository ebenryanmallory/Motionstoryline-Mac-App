Motion Storyline — First Run Guide
==================================

Why you see a warning
- This app is distributed directly from the developer’s website, not the Mac App Store.
- MacOS Gatekeeper shows a warning for unnotarized apps.
- This is expected for independent distribution. If you downloaded this DMG from the official Motion Storyline website and you trust the developer, follow one of the options below.

Option A — Open via context menu (recommended)
1) Drag “Motion Storyline.app” to the Applications folder in this window.
2) In Applications, Right‑click (or Control‑click) “Motion Storyline.app” and choose “Open”.
3) In the dialog, click “Open”. You should only have to do this once per Mac.

Option B — Allow from Privacy & Security
1) Open System Settings → Privacy & Security.
2) Scroll to the Security section.
3) If you see “Motion Storyline was blocked from opening”, click “Open Anyway”, then confirm “Open”.

Option C — Terminal (advanced users)
1) After copying the app to Applications, run:
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Motion Storyline.app"
2) Then open the app normally from Applications.

Security notes
- The app is unsigned/unnotarized in this build, so macOS can’t verify it automatically.
- Only proceed if you obtained this DMG from the official Motion Storyline website.
- This extra step will likely not be necessary in future releases.

Questions or feedback?
- If anything looks suspicious or unexpected, do not proceed and contact support@motionstoryline.com
