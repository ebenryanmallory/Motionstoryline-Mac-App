# Cursor Rules for Motion Storyline Project

# Build and Run Instructions
- DO NOT run commands to build or start the project with Xcode
- DO NOT use xcodebuild commands
- The user will manually build and run the project in Xcode
- Avoid suggesting commands that require the full Xcode application

# Code Editing Guidelines
- Prefer making changes to Swift files directly through the edit_file tool
- When editing UI components, focus on SwiftUI modifications
- Keep Swift code consistent with the existing project style
- Use proper SwiftUI lifecycle methods and property wrappers

# Error Handling
- When a line number and error description are pasted with minimal context, this indicates a bug that needs to be fixed
- Prioritize addressing the specific error mentioned in the file and line indicated
- If the error message includes a file path, focus on that file first
- Provide solutions that directly address the compiler or runtime error
- When possible, explain the root cause of the error before implementing the fix

# Project Structure
- Keep all new files within the Motion Storyline directory structure
- Follow the existing pattern of separating view components into their own files
- Maintain the existing navigation structure using NavigationStack

# Debugging Approach
- Suggest code changes that can be tested by the user in Xcode
- Provide clear explanations of what changes are being made and why
- When addressing errors, focus on Swift and SwiftUI-specific solutions

# Performance Considerations
- Be mindful of memory usage in animation components
- Suggest optimizations for rendering performance when appropriate
- Consider macOS-specific UI guidelines when making interface changes
